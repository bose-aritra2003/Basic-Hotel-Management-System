# Basic Hotel Management System

Basic Hotel Management System (in Python) is a simple console application, based on a Character User Interface. This project is used for hotel booking for individual accounts. In this CUI application we have tried to keep the language highly user friendly so that the user is properly directed through the steps of booking their hotel rooms. At the same we have also tried to maintain all the possibility which may help the user to book his/her hotel in a fast yet secured way.

## Program Features

* **USER ACCOUNTS:** This feature helps users to create theirindividual accounts so that their data is secured and bookings areeasily accessible.
* **ACCOUNT SETTINGS:** This feature helps the users to changetheir account details like username, password & email id anytimethey wish to. (Note: For changing password, the last password willalso be required for confirmation so as to prevent unauthorisedaccess to user accounts)
* **CARD VALIDITY CHECKER:** This feature allows the system tocheck the validity of a card number based on some internationallyaccepted predefined structures for credit and debit card numbers.Thus, payments are more secured.
* **INVOICE GENERATOR:** This feature provides the user with adetailed invoice at the end of every transaction. This invoice canalso be accessed later by the user through their accounts.
* **BOOKING CANCELLATION:** This feature allows the user tocancel a booking and get the refund for a booking they had donepreviously, before the booking period is over.

## Packages & Modules used

* **MYSQL.CONNECTOR:** Used for connecting **Python** (Front-end) with **MySQL** (Back-end).
* **DATETIME:** Used for calculating the date and time duration of the hotel room booking and for checking the validity of number of days.
* **SYS:** The sys module has been implemented in order to providevarious functions and variables that are used to manipulatedifferent parts of the Python runtime environment. It allowsoperating on the interpreter as it provides access to the variablesand functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
* **CSV:** This module has been implemented for storing records ofusers’ bookings in an organised manner in a csv file that can lateron be accessed in order to check/manipulate bookings.
